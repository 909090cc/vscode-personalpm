# vscode-personalpm

Heavily inspired by [vscode-pets](https://github.com/tonybaloney/vscode-pets).

WFH is great but there's something missing. This extension puts a small project manager in your project to make sure you are effectively working towards your next standup.

## Status

This extension is not yet fully released but will hopefully be coming soon to the VS Code marketplace.

## Installation

TBD

## Using Personal PM

After installing, open the command palette with `Ctrl+Shift+P` on Windows/Linux or `Cmd(âŒ˜)+Shift+P` on MacOS.

Run the "Personal PM" command (`personalpm.start`) to create your own personal ~~Lumbergh~~PM.

## Release Notes

### 1.0.0

Coming Soon!
